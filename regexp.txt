Regular Expressions:

Methods:
	RegExp:
		exec
		test
	
	String:
		match
		matchAll
		replace
		search
		split

Creating RegExp:

	RegExp literal:
		var re = /ab+c/;
	Note: Use if regexp will remain constant

Regular expression literals provide compilation of the regular expression when the script is loaded. If the regular expression remains constant, using this can improve performance.

	Constructor of RegExp:
		var re = new RegExp('ab+c');
	Note: Use if regexp will be changing

Using the constructor function provides runtime compilation of the regular expression. Use the constructor function when you know the regular expression pattern will be changing, or you don't know the pattern and are getting it from another source, such as user input.
