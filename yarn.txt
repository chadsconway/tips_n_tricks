Issues with Dependencies, helpful commands:
Trying to update nuxt, directions said delete yarn.lock
Afterwards, 
$ yarn install
did not generate new lock file
$ yarn generate-lock-entry
should
$ yarn check  // package.json vs yarn.lock
$ yarn check --integrity  // checks against hashes
$ yarn check --verify-tree  // checks to make sure package.json = node_modules
