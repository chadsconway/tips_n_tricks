middleware property - corresponds to middleware folder in scaffolding.  
	Executes - server-side when page is loaded or refreshed
	Executes - Client-side once app is mounted

serverMiddleware - Express instance
	Executes - Only on the server
	Protects private date from exploitation

To use serverMiddleware:

~nuxt.config.js
  },
   serverMiddleware: ['~/api']
 }

in root:

api/index.js

Since we’ve added our API as serverMiddleware to Nuxt’s, we’ll need to add our directory to the config. We’ll add watch to our build object, and add the relative path from root.

  */**
   *** Build configuration*
   **/*
   build: {
     watch: ['api'],
     */**
     *** You can extend webpack config here*
     **/*
     extend(config, ctx) {},
   serverMiddleware: ['~/api']
   }
