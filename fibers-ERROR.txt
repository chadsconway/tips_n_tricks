Issue: ## Error There is an issue with node-fibers ##
App: lra-v.0.4.0

Fixes Attempted:

1.	From lra-v.0.4.0 Directory:

$ yarn remove fibers

2.	lra-v.0.4.0 was using node version 10.15.1

$ nvm remove 10.15.1 
-- Got an error, said to manually remove 10.15.1

3.	fibers or node-fibers not listed in package.json so must be a dependency of something, need to figure out what:

In yarn.lock searched for fibers:

fibers has '4' occurences in yarn.lock:
	Dependency of:
	1.  @nuxtjs/vuetify@^1.9.0
	2.  fibers@^4.0.1: version 4.0.2

### THE FIX ###

Deleted:  node_modules, yarn.lock in lra-v.0.4.0
Ran:

$ yarn install
$ yarn dev
