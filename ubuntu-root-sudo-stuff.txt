Accidentally changed default shell of root and couldn't login as root.

Using winscp, opened:

	/etc/passwd

Seven fields for each entry, last entry default shell:

it was:  root:x:0:0:root:/root:/git

changed to default: root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash

Fixed login issue, accidentally changed when trying to configure auto deployment from github to user git

The PS1 variable that you see in the above image has all the required configuration for the bash prompt. Let us first explain what the characters in this variable indicate. You can view this variable clearly in the PS1 variable listed after the else statement.

    \u-This indicates the username of the current user
    \h: This indicates the hostname of the current user extracted from the fully qualified domain name.
    \w: This indicates the current working directory. Your home directory is indicated with a tilde ~ symbol.
    \$: This indicates if you are a normal user ($) or a root user (#).
