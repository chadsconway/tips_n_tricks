HTML Media:


Video:

Only MP4, WebM, and Ogg video are supported by the HTML5 standard.

Audio:

Only MP3, WAV, and Ogg audio are supported by the HTML5 standard.

The HTML <video> Element

To show a video in HTML, use the <video> element:
Example
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video> 

The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.

It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads.

The <source> element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

The text between the <video> and </video> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <video> element.

The autoplay attribute does not work in mobile devices like iPad and iPhone.

Example

Your browser does not support the audio element.
