
Running concurrent scripts:

"scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "dev": "(cd server && npm run start) & npm run start"
  }

comments:  && means npm waits for first command before running second

------------------------------------------------------------
Running concurrent scripts using:

$ npm install concurrently

"scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "dev": ""concurrently \"cd server && npm run start\" \"npm run start\""
  }

------------------------------------------------------------
Running concurrent scripts using:

$ npm install npm-run-all — save-dev

comments: three different commands, based on your needs:

    npm-run-all (the main command, which has documentation on all of the flags and additions you can pass in via the command line)
    run-s (run sequential — for when you need one command to finish before the next one starts)
    run-p (run parallel — like when both the UI and server pieces of the application need to run side by side).

If, for example, the package.json scripts looked like the following:

{
    "scripts": {
        "clean": "rimraf dist",
        "lint":  "eslint src",
        "build": "babel src -o lib"
    }
}

npm-run-all: npm-run-all clean lint build.
