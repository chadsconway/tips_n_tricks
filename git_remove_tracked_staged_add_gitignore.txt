git rm -r --cached .
git add -A
git commit -am 'Removing ignored files'

The first command will un-track all files in your git repository.

The second command will then add all of the files in your git repository, except those that match rules in your .gitignore. Thus, we have un-tracked several files with just two commands.

Then the last command is to commit the changes, which will just be removed files.
