Try:

ping 8.8.8.8
ping google.com
curl http://www.google.com
curl https://www.google.com

My case ping 8.8.8.8 worked, ping google.com did not work.

How to restore/recreate etc/resolv.conf files

$ sudo apt-get remove --purge resolvconf && sudo apt-get install resolvconf

$ reboot


Need to remove resolvconf and also purge it, removing alone not enough.  If install resolvconf doesn't work no problem.  Just restart and should be good
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Has to do with nameservers config being lost which is taken care of in

resolved.conf, resolved.conf.d - Network Name Resolution configuration files

resolvconf, etc.


Ubuntu Manual Pages:

 The default configuration is defined during compilation, so a configuration file is only
       needed when it is necessary to deviate from those defaults. By default, the configuration
       file in /etc/systemd/ contains commented out entries showing the defaults as a guide to
       the administrator. This file can be edited to create local overrides.

       When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install configuration snippets
       in /usr/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/. Files in /etc/ are reserved for the local administrator,
       who may use this logic to override the configuration files installed by vendor packages.
       The main configuration file is read before any of the configuration directories, and has
       the lowest precedence; entries in a file in any configuration directory override entries
       in the single configuration file. Files in the *.conf.d/ configuration subdirectories are
       sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of which of the subdirectories
       they reside in. If multiple files specify the same option, the entry in the file with the
       lexicographically latest name takes precedence. It is recommended to prefix all filenames
       in those subdirectories with a two-digit number and a dash, to simplify the ordering of
       the files.
